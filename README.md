# Spotted
An iOS app written in Swift. 

Spotted allows users to create galleries of cars and planes that they have spotted. These galleries can include pictures, descriptions, location at which the vehicle was spotted, and many more!
Possibilities for further categories include: movies, landmarks, countries/cities! Feel free to suggest some features.
